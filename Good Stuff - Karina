GOOD STUFF

I’m so good
I’m so mad
아무도 모르게 Let you know
I switch up,
make it look brand new
Meet me in the back
— that’s a rendezvous

I don’t need hype
Yeah, what you feel like
아닌 척 걸어 난
관심 꺼 Keep it light
Yeah, yeah, blah, blah,
Say what you like
여기 넘쳐나
I’m everybody’s type

Class is in session
Come pay attention
서서히 놀랄걸
봐 So good
Wanna take a bite?

Got me cookin’ goody goody
Yeah, you can’t get enough
I’m gettin’ money, money, money
Keep on runnin’ it up
Top down 뭔가 달라
Giddy, giddy it up
I got the GOOD STUFF
GOOD STUFF

Got me cookin’ goody goody
Yeah, it’s switched to the top
You like that honey, honey, honey
Yeah, 어질어질해
Top down, 뭔가 달라
Giddy, giddy it up
I got the GOOD STUFF
GOOD STUFF

왠지 좀 다른 느낌
Face screwed up
GOOD STUFF 색다른 기분
Get clued up
When I pull up
여기저기 물어봐
When I pull up
Everybody’s getting down

I don’t need the hype
I’m one of a kind
I got my glow in my mind
Sippin’ on that gold
and ice, ice, ice, ice
And they look good on me
So good it makes you hungry
And if KARINA said to do it
then you do it honey
